# origami + code = art + computation

To support and foster a collaborative environment around the development of Computational Origami tools, theory and applications. The group recognises and aims to foster diversity in disciplines, approaches, languages, platforms, methods, aims and objectives. 

Our efforts extend in many directions, including curating and collating existing projects with the aim of giving researchers an overview of reference material. This in turn can assist in idenfying solved problems and active areas ripe for, and active with, collaboration. 

The group acknowledges courtesy, aims to support and acknowledge academic references, authorship and collaborative authorship. Members may contribute open and or compiled sources, however, the main utility of origami + code is to consider interoperabilty as a primary design concern. Project contributors should aim to include academic and or prior art within the source code. The concept of idea dependency is very interesting in origami.

## background

Within the field of Computer Science, optimization algorithms and particularly the field of *Computational Origami* [[1]](#1)[[2]](#2) has taken up much of the load of enabling design, modelling and simulation to assist researchers in finding new solutions. The practical art of origami is active in contributing through its artists’ creative exploits that result in significant knowledge production related to new origami patterns. Within the artistic field of origami, the technical origamists are extending the domain of their toolkits through the development of computational origami tools. Many artist-developed software tools such as those developed by Lang, Tachi, Resch, Mitani, Demaine, Kraft have developed a broad range of tool, ranging from single domain problem solution tools, to generic solvers. A key problem in the domain is interoperability, and so many solutions fields remain separated. We hope to facilitate cooperation and community towards, as well as to initate new projects, new possibilities for artistic, academic and design practices of all kinds.
